At the Center of Biostatistics and Aids Research at Harvard University, I work on a variety of HIV/Aids related health studies. A key aspect of health studies involving participants with HIV/AIDS is tracking their use of 
antiretroviral (ARV) medications. Over the past three decades, many ARV medications have been approved by the FDA, with even more currently in the approval pipeline. Historically, a SAS tool was developed to clean and 
standardize medication treatment data by aligning drug codes with drug names, identifying inconsistencies, and creating two cleaned datasets for analysis. While the FDA-approved medication list was updated manually, 
these updates ceased several years ago. As a result, researchers collecting medication data for participants often encountered new drugs not included in the original tool. This led to incomplete regimen data in the final 
datasets, delaying study deliverables.

Goal: Automate the extraction of the most up-to-date FDA-approved ARV medications from the https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/fda-approved-hiv-medicines website.
