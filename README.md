# Yashodhan Aher: Data-Portfolio

Hi, I’m Yashodhan (nickname: Yoshi), and welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find projects I've completed for both professional work and personal learning or hobby purposes. I graduated from Bentley University in 2021 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. Since then, I've held various data-driven roles across different industries, working with diverse data sources such as financial data, pharmaceutical prescription data, and clinical trial data, among others. My experience spans multiple business units in both academic and private sectors, allowing me to develop a well-rounded skill set. Through these roles, I've gained a strong foundation in business acumen, programming, data analysis, data management, effective communication, and project management—essential skills for any data professional.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics and programming skills. In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Away from work I enjoy reading economic and tech related articles as well as books in 
the genre of fantasy and thriller. 

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
