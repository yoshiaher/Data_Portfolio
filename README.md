# Yashodhan Aher: Data-Portfolio

Hi, I’m Yashodhan (nickname: Yoshi), and welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find projects I've completed for both professional work and personal learning or hobby purposes. I graduated from Bentley University in 2021 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. Since then, I've held various data-driven roles across different industries, working with diverse data sources such as financial data, pharmaceutical prescription data, and clinical trial data, among others. My experience spans multiple business units in both academic and private sectors, allowing me to develop a well-rounded skill set. Through these roles, I've gained a strong foundation in business acumen, programming, data analysis, data management, effective communication, and project management—essential skills for any data professional.

Currently, I work as a Statistical Programmer for the Center of Biostatistics in Aids Research where I specifically support PHACS. The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) network conducts multiple longitudinal cohort studies investigating the long-term effects of HIV and antiretroviral (ARV) medications in children and young adults who were born with HIV or born exposed to HIV. These studies follow newborns, young children, adolescents, and young adults.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics and programming skills. Beyond my technical skills, I am a strong analytical thinker with excellent problem-solving skills. I approach data analysis strategically, identifying key issues and opportunities. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Away from work I enjoy watching and playing sports, movies, and reading economic and tech related articles as well as books in the genre of fantasy and thriller. 

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
