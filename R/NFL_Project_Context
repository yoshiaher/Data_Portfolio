When this project idea was first conceived, Week 18 of the 2024 NFL season had just concluded and the playoff teams had been determined. I thought it would be both fun
and educational to dive into the numbers and see how the players at the most impactful position (Quarterback) performed during the regular season and to get a sense of 
where each QB stands relative to the other playoff QBs. 

First, the scope of this project is limited to playoff teams only.
