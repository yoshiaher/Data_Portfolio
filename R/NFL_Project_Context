The goal of this project was to compare the regular season peformace of each of the fourteen quarterbacks who made the playoffs. Most fans looking to get a sense of how 
good each quarterback is will refer to ESPN or NFL.com and look at their basic statistics. Although these measures are a good starting point, they have many limitations.

One limitation is that these measures of performance are far more meaningful when looked at in conjunction with other critical context. For example, if Sam Darnold threw 
36 touchdowns and Baker Mayfield threw 44 touchdowns, at first glance it wouldappear that Baker had the more impressive season according to this metric. However, if you add 
context about each player's offensive line and find that Sam Darnold's offensiv eline was ranked far below Baker's, then you would realize there's a strong argument that Sam 
in fact had a more impressive season despite having less touchdowns. 

Another limitation is that many of these statistics are expressed as an aggregate or reflect a single time point. Neither of these data forms tells the whole story. If two 
quarterbacks finish with 20 interceptions but one QB had no interceptions in the last 5 weeks and the other had 10 in the last five weeks, then the manner in which both QBs got 
to 20 interceptions paints two different stories. This would not be discernible unless you were able to measure this metric over time. 

Finally,
