The goal of this project was to create a single source of reporting that would convey far richer insights about the regular season performance of QBs headed to the playoffs 
than anything that could be found via a simple Google search. The nflverse package in R has datasets stored in a variety of structures such as one record per play, one record 
per week, one record per player, etc., and this flexbility enabled me to generate unique insights. The specific objectives in this project were as follows:

Aggregate Basic Stats such as Total Touchdowns, Interceptions, etc., and derive metrics to contextualize these statistics: Offensive Line Rank, Strength of Schedule, Defensive
Rank, Receiving Core Rank
        -Basic counting stats like touchdowns and interceptions provide a surface-level view of a quarterback's performance, but they don't tell the whole story. Contextual 
         metrics such as offensive line rank and strength of schedule help assess whether a QB's performance was aided or hindered by external factors. For example, a high 
         interception count might be less concerning if the QB faced a top-tier schedule, while a high touchdown total could be inflated by weak competition.

Plot Mean EPA over time and who the opponent that week was
        -Expected Points Added (EPA) is a widely used advanced metric that measures a player's contribution to scoring relative to the expected outcome of a given situation. 
         Tracking EPA trends over the season and linking them to specific opponents helps identify patterns in performance, such as whether a QB consistently excels against 
         weaker defenses or struggles against playoff-caliber opponents. This provides insight into consistency and adaptability.

Plot third down conversion rates at different distances
        -Third down performance is a crucial indicator of a quarterback's efficiency in high-pressure situations. Breaking down conversion rates by distance (e.g., short, 
         medium, long) helps evaluate a QB's ability to sustain drives and make clutch plays. 

Measure completion percentage when pressured
        -A quarterback's ability to maintain accuracy under pressure is a key determinant of their success, especially in playoff scenarios where defenses are more aggressive.
         By analyzing completion rates under pressure, we can assess how well a QB handles defensive pressure which is crucial for evaluating resilience and composure in tough
         situations.

For the purpose of this analysis, I thought these objectives were very thorough. They ensure that both basic and advanced metrics are used, both longitudinal and cross-sectional 
data are used, and a variety of situations are covered such as QB play in clutch moments (third down conversion) or less than perfect conditions (completion percetnage unde pressure).
