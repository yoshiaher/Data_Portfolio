The Health Outcomes around Pregnancy and Exposure to HIV/Antiretrovirals (HOPE) study is a prospective observational cohort study designed to investigate physical and mental health outcomes of young 
women living with HIV as they age, including HIV disease course, engagement in care, reproductive health and choices and cardiometabolic health. Upon enrollment, women are stratified into the following
buckets: 1=Nulliparous and nonpregnant, 2=pregnant, 3=recently delivered, 4=within 1 yr postpartum, 5=parous and non-pregnant. Depending on the stratification, there is different data that is collected 
during the study period for which the women are followed. The data is collected via specially designed forms called CRFs. The task for this project was to derive a cutoff date for each participant that 
would represent the earliest timepoint that we could retrieve viral load and CD4 data from other studies that the HOPE participants had been co-enrolled in. The cutoff date derivation was dependent on 
the stratificaiton of the participant:

For individuals classified as nulliparous and non-pregnant or parous and non-pregnant, the cutoff date is calculated as one year before the entry visit date (entryvisdt – 1 year). Since there is no pregnancy 
involvement, the cutoff is based solely on the entry visit date, and no last menstrual period date (lmpdt) is required. 
  
For those in the pregnant group, the cutoff date is determined by subtracting six months from the lmpdt (lmpdt – 6 months). The lmpdt is primarily obtained from the EVW0380 
dataset. However, if the lmpdt is missing, it is estimated using gestational weeks from the anstab dataset by calculating lmpdt = randdt – gestational weeks, where the randomization date (randdt) is used instead 
of the entry visit date to align with the enrollment period.

Participants classified as recently delivered have their cutoff date calculated as six months before the lmpdt (lmpdt – 6 months). In this case, the lmpdt is derived by subtracting the gestational age from 
the most recent pregnancy date (pregdt), which is obtained from the EVW0379, QLW0360, or anstab datasets using the formula lmpdt = pregdt – gestational age.

For those in the within 1 year postpartum group, the cutoff date is also calculated as six months before the lmpdt (lmpdt – 6 months). Similar to the recently delivered group, the lmpdt is determined by 
subtracting the gestational age from the most recent pregnancy date (pregdt). If gestational age data is missing in EVW0379, the pregnancy length is approximated using data from QLW0360. If the available data 
indicates “37 weeks or more,” a default of 40 weeks is assumed. If no such data is available, a default of 40 weeks is used in the calculation, resulting in lmpdt = pregdt – 40 weeks. The pregnancy date (pregdt)
is sourced from EVW0379, QLW0360, or anstab.

Any calculation that uses entryvisitdt, if it is unavailable, then the randdt is used. Additionally, when choosing which pregdt to use in the relevant calculations, there is a hierarchy that goes as follows: use 
the pregdt from EVW0379, if it's missing then QLW0360, if its missing, then Anstab. 

Challenge: The primary challenge lies in the differing structures of each form, which makes it difficult to compare and accurately select the correct pregnancy date (pregdt). Specifically, Form EVW0379 records one
pregnancy per participant per observation, while Form QLW0360 records up to two pregnancies per participant per observation. In contrast, the anstab form follows a completely different structure, with one column containing 
questions and another containing responses, requiring filtering to extract the relevant gestational age and pregnancy date information. The inconsistencies across these forms present a significant hurdle in standardizing the
data for analysis.

Solution: To address this challenge, the program processes each form individually to restructure the data, ensuring that all pregnancy dates and corresponding gestational ages are consolidated into a single observation per 
participant. This transformation allows for filtering to retain only the latest pregnancy date along with its associated gestational age. Once the forms are standardized and subsetted, they are merged into a unified dataset, 
ensuring that all necessary variables for calculations across different stratification groups are available in one place. Most importantly, this process aligns all relevant information for each participant on a single row, 
facilitating accurate and efficient cutoff date (cutoffdt) calculations.
